# crochetWebsiteWebProject
Full-Stack Web Application (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL)
This project is a **full-stack web application** developed as part of an academic semester project to demonstrate practical implementation of **frontend–backend communication, authentication, and database integration**.

The application allows users to **sign up, log in, and interact with dynamic content** using a secure and structured architecture. The frontend is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while the backend is powered by **Node.js and Express**, with **PostgreSQL** used for data persistence.

 Key Features
* User **Signup & Login** functionality
* **Password hashing** using bcrypt for secure authentication
* **JWT-based authentication** for session management
* RESTful API design using Express
* PostgreSQL database integration
* Modular folder structure (routes, controllers, models)
* Error handling and validation
* Frontend–backend communication using Fetch API


Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Security:** bcrypt, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* **Tools:** npm, Postman, pgAdmin

 Project Structure

 └── style.css
```

This modular structure improves **maintainability, scalability, and readability** by separating concerns across different layers of the application.

Security Implementation
* Passwords are **never stored in plain text**
* bcrypt with salt rounds is used for hashing
* JWT ensures secure user authentication and authorization
* Environment variables are used for sensitive credentials

Learning Outcomes
* Understanding of **client–server architecture**
* Hands-on experience with **REST APIs**
* Secure authentication implementation
* Database CRUD operations using PostgreSQL
* Debugging and error handling in full-stack applications

Future Enhancements

* Role-based access control (Admin/User)
* Improved UI/UX
* Profile management
* Deployment to cloud platforms
